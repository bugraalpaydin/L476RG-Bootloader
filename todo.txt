.elf = executable and linkable format
linker = memory layout, where to put everything, flash memory start address, ram start address and how big are these 
source code -> compiler -> .elf -> linker script -> final executable -> flash programmer (writes only to flash memory) -> mcu 
startup code initilazie the ram and this code runs before main
global variables initialized  (.data + .const) RAM+FLASH
const variables goes to flash memory, .const section because they will never change throughout the program 
global variables that are not initialized goes into .bss section
local variables that are initialized goes into (.stack +.const) RAM+FLASH .const) RAM+FLASH 

i added button driver and it is working, i need to see if i hold the button pressing, is it incremensing or is it holds its value. dont use NVIC_EnableIRQ and NVIC_SetPriority instead use nvic registers

after that maybe i add 2 different program and make a serial menu for it, i could choose the program that i want to go and when i am in the application i return to the bootloader 

bir bootloaderın kullandığı peripheral kullanıcının attığı kodda configure edilirse ne olur.
